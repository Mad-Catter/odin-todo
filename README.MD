This is a simple todo project.
I am overall happy with how I did with it.
I am unsure how well I kept to the SOLID principles however.  
Many times I found getting stuck in my own head about how to proceed, so I just started writing code to get something on the page to help me get started.
However, I believe this lead to me breaking many Solid Principles.  Specifically the Single Responsibility Principle.

The calendar view is something that was not required but the odin project, but it has been something I wanted to try for a bit.
I am happy with how I did with it, but it did all quite a bit of time to this project.
