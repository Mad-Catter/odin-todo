Template.html has a display of todos and a potential calendar display.
When template.html wants to create a new todo, a form will be opened up with a required title and optional description, notes, due date, checklist, priority, and folder.
Title, descriptions, and notes are all text inputs.
Checklists are also a text input with an additional marker to say if they are true or not.
The due date opens up a calendar where you select a day and a checkbox to optionally choose an hour.
Priority is a sliding scale that, for now, lets say starts with 0-3.  The lower the priority the less important it is.
Folders is a list of folders that the todo can go into.

Index.js has an event listener waiting for the form to finish and will take the data and give make a new todo from it.

There are two different displays for todos.  One tab shows todos sorted by how soon they need to be done or sorted by how recently they were added.
Options to only show certain folders.
Each todo shows a name, possibly short description, a color based off of urgency, and a banner showing how many days left until due date.
Clicking onto a todo opens up the todo with a possibly longer description, checklists, and a tab for notes.  Options to mark it as complete, delete it, or add to different folders.

Second is a calendar view which also shows todos on each day


Problems:
The calendar.  How do I select a time and how do I make an accurate calendar,
Google calendar uses a table instead of a calendar which I like.  I still need a way to accurately make the calendar though.
