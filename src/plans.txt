Template.html has a display of todos and a potential calendar display.
When template.html wants to create a new todo, a form will be opened up with a required title and optional description, notes, due date, checklist, priority, and folder.
Title, descriptions, and notes are all text inputs.
Checklists are also a text input with an additional marker to say if they are true or not.
The due date opens up a calendar where you select a day and a checkbox to optionally choose an hour.
Priority is a sliding scale that, for now, lets say starts with 0-3.  The lower the priority the less important it is.
Folders is a list of folders that the todo can go into.

Index.js has an event listener waiting for the form to finish and will take the data and give make a new todo from it.

There are two different displays for todos.  One tab shows todos sorted by how soon they need to be done or sorted by how recently they were added.
Options to only show certain folders.
Each todo shows a name, possibly short description, a color based off of urgency, and a banner showing how many days left until due date.
Clicking onto a todo opens up the todo with a possibly longer description, checklists, and a tab for notes.  Options to mark it as complete, delete it, or add to different folders.

Second is a calendar view which also shows todos on each day


Problems:
The calendar.  How do I select a time and how do I make an accurate calendar,
Google calendar uses a table instead of a calendar which I like.  I still need a way to accurately make the calendar though.



Currently The time cant have any spaces between the time and the am/pm or the calendar view may overflow.  

Remaining needs {
  todos {
    A display of what folders they are in

  }
  Optional {
    Create a new time input if I dont respect my own time still.
    folders {
      A way to edit folder names
      (And need to edit the folder creator to have todos).
    }
  }
}

Things to regenerate {
  the folder list
  the folder list inside of the new todo view
  The calendar view.
  the card view
  
}

I could change the error popup to be a bit more clear that is an error, some red colors perhaps.
super optional {
  Change Todo priority, name, due date, and desc.
  Have things regenerate more often based off of completion status
}

  Cleaning up code {
    Does the code follow the SOLID principles?  If not how much work is it to fix?  What can I do in the future to better follow SOLID principles?
    Add Proper comments.
  }
  Optional details {
    The ability to change properties of todos and the folder names.
